**Simple MA Deviation** is an expert advisor that opens transactions based on the difference in number of points of the current price and the moving average. If the current price is at X number of points above moving average, EA opens a sell, otherwise if it is at X points below moving average, EA opens a buy. This deviation can be invalidated based on a number of candles (to filter deviation based on how fast it happened). Order is closed when price reaches the moving average once again.
